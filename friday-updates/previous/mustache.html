				<div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">Parents,<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We're headed into the last week of school, which means, a lot going on. Most of the necessary information is in the parent newsletter that went home, but I'd like to reiterate the following...<ul><li>All next week is free dress, though it's important the class dress up Thursday for the Honors Assembly and Friday for the All-School Mass.&nbsp;</li><li>Speaking of the Honors Assembly.&nbsp;Sixth and Seventh Grade is at 11 a.m. And afterward, at noon, everyone is welcome to attend the St. Paul TPG Book Fair, Pizza &amp; Ice Cream Social. Check for the flyer in the red folders.</li><li>Tuesday is our Park Day at Pier Park. We'll leave school at 9:30 to walk to the park, and we'll get back to school around 3. A note (orange paper) went home today in the red folders regarding Park Day.</li><li>Last day of school is Friday, June 10. We have an All-School Mass at 9:30, with dismissal soon after.</li></ul><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; It has been an amazing year, and I hope the class has had as much fun as I have. Thank you all for everything throughout the year, from planning and chaperoning events to all the kind words and support&nbsp;and everything between. It all means a lot and know that it is -- and you are -- appreciated.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Have a great weekend and see everyone next week.<br />&#8203; &nbsp; &nbsp; Mr. Hakim&nbsp;</div>

				<div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">Parents,<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Thank you to everyone who came Wednesday night to the eighth grade's Book Launch Party. I know they were all really excited about it and were happy to share the moment with you all. All their hard work these past few weeks will hopefully pay off as we get the word out more.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; For those who were there, and for others who might be interested, the website to purchase the ebook (it's only available in ebook format, not in hardcover) is smashwords.com. Create a login, search for the book, which is called, <em>What Happens in Vegas Ends in Vegas</em>, and click the buy now button. EPUB files are for iBooks or any other EPUB software/application; MOBI (KINDLE) is for the Amazon Kindle device or app; and PDF is for the computer.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, the book is only available through Smashwords, but we're hoping to pass the site's distribution premium catalog requirements. Once that happens, Smashwords will distribute it to Amazon, Apple, Barnes and Noble and other online companies. According to the website, It typically takes up to a week or two to find out if we've met all the requirements.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But if you're at all interested, please do buy the book, as all the money raised will go toward The Arc Grosse Pointe/Harper Woods. You can also find the link to purchase the book -- and more -- on the book website the students created, <a target="_blank" href="http://spcsbooks.wix.com/spcs-class-of-2016">spcsbooks.wix.com/spcs-class-of-2016</a><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Thank you all!<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Here's what to expect for next week...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#8d2424"><strong>Sixth Grade</strong></font>: I've pushed back the debate day, as this week as a little scrambled with the Toledo Zoo field and I had an AOD meeting Wednesday. So, the debate will be Wednesday. We'll use Tuesday to put together notes and citations in preparation for the debate. Thursday and Friday will be a discussion on present-day Latin America and how the three ancient civilizations, as well as the Europeans, influenced the region.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#8d2424"><strong>Seventh Grade</strong></font>: We're finishing up our Commemorative Plates for Russia. They're due Tuesday, at which point the students will present them and we'll discuss each figure's impact on creating Russia as it is today. The rest of the week will focus on present-day Russia -- it's economy, government, world relationships, etc.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#8d2424"><strong>Eighth Grade</strong></font>: Get ready to graduate. <br />&#8203;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I hope everyone has a wonderful Memorial Day weekend. Should be great weather! See you all Tuesday.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Hakim&nbsp;</div>

				<div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">Parents,<br /><br /><font color="#626262">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; I'd like to start by thanking the eighth graders and others who organized the newspaper luncheon today. It was an incredible gesture from the group and a very enjoyable lunch. Thank you! We hope you enjoy the last issue of the year. In regards to the issue, any eighth graders/parents who'd like the Eighth Grade Goodbye section in color, please let me know. Please do so by next Thursday, so I can get everyone a copy of it before graduation.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; There's a lot going on these next few weeks. Please check previous posts for important dates/announcements. Reminders for events this week:&nbsp;<ul><li>Monday at 2:15 the sixth grade gets to have ice cream with Msgr. Halfpenny for their efforts in the annual Stump the Msgr.</li><li>Tuesday is the sixth grade field trip... Thank you again to all who volunteered to chaperone!&nbsp;<br /></li><li>Wednesday is the eighth grade Book Launch Party, from 6-8 p.m. at the Canfield Center. More on that in the eighth grade Week Ahead&nbsp;section below.&nbsp;</li><li>Friday is No School, courtesy of Msgr. Halfpenny.</li></ul><br />&#8203; &nbsp; &nbsp; We're into the final three weeks of school, two weeks for the eighth grade. Here's a breakdown of what to expect...<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</font><br /><font color="#626262">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; </font><strong><font color="#8d2424">Sixth grade</font></strong><font color="#626262">: We've finished talking about the ancient Mesoamerican civilizations and are prepping for the Great Debate on Wednesday (for 6-1), Thursday for (6-2). We'll use Monday and Tuesday to discuss the debate process and format. As (I think) I mentioned in previous posts, we'll end the year in present-day Latin America, discussing the influences of those ancient civilizations and of the Europeans on the region.</font><br /><font color="#626262">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; </font><strong><font color="#8d2424">Seventh Grade</font></strong><font color="#626262">: We started Russia this week, noting how it's a country of opposites -- hot and cold (Siberia), mountainous and flat, wet and dry -- and focused on the physical geography of the land. We also went into the influences of Russian past, namely the Byzantines, Mongols and Vikings. The class will use that information to now focus on individuals within those groups and others in Russia's past to create a commemorative plate in honor of that person. Some of the influential figures include Ivan the Great, Ivan the Terrible, Peter the Great, Catherine the Great, Vladimir Lenin, Prince Rurik and others.</font><br /><font color="#8d2424">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; </font><font color="#8d2424"><strong>Eighth Grade</strong></font>: The anthology is nearing its completion. We're hoping to have it submitted by Monday and out in time for the book launch party Wednesday night. It'll be a special night for the class, who has worked to put this all together in such a short time. The event planning team has been amazing in organizing everything for the party, as have all the other groups in getting the word out and putting the book together. We hope you're able to attend the party Wednesday night.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;One final note -- Congratulations to all the eighth graders who're making their Confirmation tonight and tomorrow! It'll be a great weekend, and I hope everyone enjoys the beautiful weather!&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mr. Hakim&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

				<div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">Parents,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; I hope everyone is well. It was a fun week this week, highlighted by Field Day on Thursday. Weather reports called for scattered thunderstorms around lunchtime, but fortunately, storms held off until later on. Unfortunately for the kids, the Hakim Curse continued and we finished last (same in TAP Basketball the past two years and last year's Field Day). Despite the results, everyone had a great time and their effort was outstanding. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Other upcoming events for sixth grade include the Toledo Zoo May 24 and Park Day June 7.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Additionally, the eighth grade was amazing in its bake sale. Thank you to all the students and parents who contributed. The class raised about $330, proceeds of which will help fund the book launch party for the Class of 2016's poetry and short story anthology. We've set the date for the launch party, Wednesday, May 25, from 6 to 8 p.m. at the Canfield Center. The event planning team is working hard on the details. More information is forthcoming, but it'll be a great night and a chance for the class to share some of their stories, their excitement in publishing their work, and their creative process. I'm really proud of the work they've put in so far and in what's to come. I hope they're happy with the results.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; That said, here's what else we're working on in class next week...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#8d2424"><strong>Sixth Grade</strong></font>: Early next week (Monday or Tuesday) we'll finish the Inca and then quickly discuss the Aztecs and Mayans. It'll likely be the Aztecs next week and Mayans early the following week, with our Great Debate occurring either Wednesday or Thursday, May 25/26. In addition to notes and assignments, the classes are conducting more thorough research into their civilization and putting it all together into a PowerPoint/presentation of some kind that they'll use in the debate.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#8d2424"><strong>Seventh Grade</strong></font>: In discussing economics, the class spent the past few days relating it to Major League Baseball and focused on the question -- Does a high team salary equate to wins/championships (and in turn, more fans, more exposure and higher revenue) or is overspending not economical? We're moving on into Russia next week, where we'll end the year discussing the geography, history and economics of the country.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#8d2424"><strong>Eighth Grade</strong></font>: Both classes have their literature final Monday. They received a copy of the final Thursday/Friday and can use the back of the sheet to build an argument/jot down any notes needed to answer the question. It's an essay question, 2-3 pages in length, where they'll need to build and support an argument using textual evidence. The rest of the week is dedicated to the book, which will hopefully be submitted to Smashwords by the end of next week or early the following week.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; I hope everyone has a great weekend and best of luck to the sports teams, some in their final games of the season.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Mr. Hakim&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8203; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

				<div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;"><br />Parents,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; This should be a quick update. All the dates remain from the past two weeks, with only one addition -- Honors/Awards Assembly is June 9. Time will be announced soon. Additionally, I just want to remind the sixth grade parents about our field trip to the Toledo Zoo May 24. Thank you to all those who volunteered to chaperon. Mrs. Schultz and I will send out an e-mail next week some time with more details. We should be able to get everyone in, but please remember to turn in the 17.00 fee so we can submit payment to the zoo.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Also, for eighth grade parents, a permission slip went home Monday of this week for the short story/poetry anthology we're publishing. Please let me know if you never received one. And thank you to those who offered to come in and speak. I'll be in touch with you to set up days/times to share your expertise with the classes.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; With that, here's what we're doing in class next week:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#8d2424"><strong>Sixth Grade</strong></font>: We're finishing up the Inca next week and will have a quiz on them early the following week -- Tuesday, May 16, is likely -- before moving on to the Aztecs and Mayans. It'll be a quick two weeks through both civilizations, and we'll culminate the year with a great debate on the best of the three civilizations and a discussion on present-day Latin America.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#8d2424"><strong>Seventh Grade</strong></font>: The class had some fun learning about economics concepts of scarcity, factors of production, opportunity costs, absolute and comparative advantages and specialization of labor. We'll focus on human capital and laws of supply and demand and equilibrium before bringing it all together with a baseball economics activity and restructuring our European markets to make them better businesses.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#8d2424"><strong>Eighth Grade</strong></font>: Both classes have started work on the short story/poetry anthology. Teams were chosen, our book theme and title were both voted on and everything is under way. Our book cover contest ends Tuesday, and the classes will vote on the best cover design, which the marketing team will then upload to Smashwords, along with a promotional blurb about the book. It's full bore from there until May 26 (tentative) with the launch party. The event-planning team will have more on that toward week's end.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Have a great weekend!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Mr. Hakim&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />&#8203; &nbsp; &nbsp; P.S. Happy Mother's Day to all!<br /></div>

				<div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">Parents,<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It's May, and it's shaping up to be an extremely busy month. In addition to the dates from last week, here are a few more to take note of...<ul><li>Wednesday, May 4, at 1:30 p.m. -- ACES Day:&nbsp;It's a&nbsp;statewide program designed to motivate students to exercise.</li><li>Friday, May 6, after Mass -- May Crowning</li><li>Saturday, May 7, at 9 a.m. -- St. Paul Annual Fun Run/Walk</li><li>Wednesday, May 11 -- Bike Inspection Day</li><li>Thursday, May 12 -- Annual Picnic Lunch</li><li>Tuesday, May 24 -- Sixth Grade Field Trip to Toledo Zoo (See Permission Slip)</li></ul>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Please let me know if you have any questions related to any dates posted this week or last. If I don't know the answer I can at least point you to the right direction or find out for you.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Additionally, there's a Family Satisfaction Survey that you'll receive next week. Yours and your children's feedback matter, so please take the time to fill out the survey.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That's all going on outside the classroom. Here's what to expect in class next week...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#8d2424"><strong>Sixth Grade</strong></font>: The classes have discussed the Inca and how they adapted to their surroundings (in the Andes) in terms of weather and vegetation and food. They created relief maps out of Play Dough and contrasted where and how we get our food versus how the Inca get theirs. We're sticking with the Inca for another week, focusing more on how they lived and the various cultural advancements they made that still impact us today.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#8d2424"><strong>Seventh Grade</strong></font>: I mentioned last week that we'd get into our unit on Russia. But before that, we're going to use our European Mini Market from last week as a stepping stone into a brief discussion of economics. For the next two weeks, we'll discuss scarcity, opportunity costs, supply and demand, specialization of labor and other topics related to economics and relate them to our Market and how we could actually start a business based on products from the Market.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#8d2424"><strong>Eighth Grade</strong></font>: For the rest of the year, both classes are going to plan, design, write and publish an anthology of flash fiction, short stories and/or poetry. We'll publish it through the online distributor, Smashwords, and will have a launch party toward the end of the month. My hope is they get the real-world experience of marketing themselves, planning events, layout and design, website design, publishing and authorship. I'm also hoping they have a lot of fun with it.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For that to happen, I need to make sure it's OK with all of you.&nbsp;I'll introduce the project to both classes Monday and will send home a parent permission slip as well. I'll also post all the project information on my website, in case you're curious about it. As well, I'll try to maintain weekly progress updates.<br />&#8203; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Have a great weekend!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Mr. Hakim&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

				<div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">Parents,<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was good seeing some of you at the Spring Concert yesterday. The kids were incredible, and I was amazed at the talent on display with the solos and instrumentals. They all showed such poise, and it was remarkable to see it, especially from those who are otherwise so reserved/shy during the day.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Another great thing was the 7th grade European Market Day. Thank you to all the parents who helped your sons/daughters make the food. I have to imagine some of you were told last minute, so it was probably a mad rush to get it done after the concert last night. It's all greatly appreciated and the kids had a lot of fun enjoying the tastes of Europe and learning about the different countries represented in the process.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Speaking of process, we're in the process of solidifying some important end-of-the-year dates. As noted in a previous update, the last day of school is now June 10. It's moved up a few days, giving us an earlier/longer summer break. Additionally, here are some dates for upcoming events/activities for the junior high...<ul><li>8th grade final exams are scheduled for the weeks of May 16 and 23. Finals Weeks opens with the&nbsp;literature final,&nbsp;May 16. Check the calendar for the remaining classes.</li><li>8th grade Confirmation is May 20-21, Cedar Point trip is June 1, Park Day is June 3, and graduation is June 6.</li><li>6th and 7th grade Park Day is June 7 at Pier Park.</li><li>There's also a field trip in the works for he 6th grade, possibly to the Toledo Zoo. It's tentatively scheduled for May 24, with more details to come soon.</li><li>TAP Basketball Finals and students v. teachers games are Tuesday, April 26. Teachers have added&nbsp;more&nbsp;talent this year, so we'll definitely be ready for the game.&nbsp;</li></ul>Please ch<font color="#818181">eck back for any further </font>updates to the schedule.<br />&#8203; &nbsp; &nbsp; Here's a breakdown of next week<font color="#818181">'s plans...<br /></font><br /><font color="#818181">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; </font><strong><font color="#8d2424">Sixth Grade</font></strong><font color="#818181">: We had a brief introduction into the ancient civilizations of Latin America this week and will continue next week learning about each civilization individually. We're starting with the Inca, focusing on how they used their environment/surroundings to thrive and survive as they did. As well, we've started developing an analytical reading comprehension skill based on the idea of <em>Talking to the Text. </em>It's a form of annotation and reading actively rather than passively.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;In conjunction with the unit, we're planning for a debate at the end in which each group of students (three groups total) will debate the topic of Who is the greatest civilization?</font><br /><font color="#8d2424">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; </font><font color="#8d2424"><strong>Seventh Grade</strong></font>: As mentioned above, the seventh graders concluded their European Market Day this week. We had representations from Italy, Spain, UK, Poland, Belgium, Lichtenstein, France, Switzerland, Ukraine, Czech Republic, Sweden, Greece, Ireland and others. Most made food, but some made crafts related to their country. It also had a business aspect to it as the students decided how much to charge for their product, the different strategies necessary to sell their products and the benefits of making money off their product.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We'll begin next week with a debriefing on the unit, before getting into our unit on Russia.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#8d2424"><strong>Eighth Grade</strong></font>: We're working on our comparison/contrast essays for <em>The Giver</em> and another dystopian novel. Essays are due Friday, April 29. Students have to generate a thesis in relation to both novels and must use evidence from both novels to support their thesis/argument. The purpose is for them to learn to narrow their focus when writing and to write in an analytical and critical way as opposed to simply summarizing.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&#8203; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Have a great weekend!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Mr. Hakim<br /></div>

				<div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">Parents,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; There's a lot going on at school this week and next. We were given a positive review from the accreditation team who visited Monday and Tuesday; the 47 members of safety patrol had a great time at the Tigers game Tuesday and got to see an 8-2 Tigers victory along with a pizza buffet at Hockeytown prior to the game; and Upland Hills Farm visited Wednesday and brought along a cow, chicken, goat, pigs and other animals. There are some great pictures on St. Paul's Instagram and Facebook pages.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Lacrosse also began its season this week and track this past weekend.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It's not slowing down at all next week. We have a Jump Rope/Hoops for Heart event Monday, with the sixth graders meeting at 1:30. Money raised through Jump Rope/Hoops for Heart benefits the American Heart Association. Donations are due next Friday, April 22. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Also next week, the eighth grade field trip to the Holocaust Museum Tuesday, as well as Spring Concert rehearsal Wednesday morning and the Spring Concert Thursday night. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The TAP Basketball championship game is Tuesday as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&#8203; &nbsp; &nbsp; Below is the breakdown of next week's class schedule...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#8d2424"><strong>Sixth Grade</strong></font>: Monday begins the next topic in our Latin America unit -- Latin American history and the ancient civilizations of the Inca, Maya and Aztec. We'll start off with an introduction on the topic and will move on to discussing each civilization individually.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#8d2424"><strong>Seventh Grade</strong></font>: The class is working on its European Mini-Market Economy reports and products. For the most part, research is over and the class has begun working on the outline and writing portion. Additionally, they'll start the week with a few days of organizing and developing their products for Friday's Economy Day. <strong>Outlines are due Monday, April 18</strong>.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<font color="#8d2424"><strong> Eighth Grade</strong></font>: We've reached the climax of <em>The Giver</em> and will finish the novel Monday. Which means, if they haven't already, the classes need to finish their additional dystopian novel. We're going to start comparing and contrasting the two novels Monday in planning and preparing for their papers due April 29. <strong>For homework this weekend, please finish the novel and the worksheet on Release</strong>.&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Have a great weekend and enjoy the break in the weather!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Mr. Hakim<br /></div>

				<div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">Parents,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; I hope everyone enjoyed their vacations, whether traveling or staying at home, and had a nice Easter. We're nearing the home stretch, heading into the fourth quarter on Monday and with only two months left of school and few breaks between. Something important to note relating to breaks. Summer break just got a little longer. Instead of getting out June 14 as previously scheduled, the last day of school is now Friday, June 10. More information about it should be in the newsletter e-mailed out today.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Another important announcement -- on Monday and Tuesday the Accreditation Team is visiting school, a "quality assurance" process that occurs every seven years. Being accredited is important and represents the school's continued commitment to standards of academic excellence, strengthening faith and building relationships. The team of associate superintendents, principals and teachers will sift through binders full of documented examples of this commitment. As well, they'll speak with a few students, teachers and others about the school. Parents, too, I'm sure, just in case someone stops you in the hallway to talk.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Additionally on Tuesday, safety patrol will attend the Tigers game against the Pittsburgh Pirates, with lunch at Hockeytown beforehand. We also have Upland Hills Farm coming in Wednesday. Should be a fun and interesting time for all.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Here's what to expect in class next week...<br />&#8203;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <strong><font color="#8d2424">Sixth Grade</font></strong>: The classes just finished making board games representing Latin America and its physical geography. We'll get into physical features' effects on the climate and vegetation of the region and will have a quiz on Wednesday or Thursday, before moving into the history of the region. Namely, the Inca, Maya and Aztec civilizations.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#8d2424"><strong>Seventh Grade</strong></font>: We started our unit on Europe this week, which encompasses a mini-market economy. Everyone chose a European country to research -- geography, history, culture, language, economy, etc. -- and a product associated with that country (Greek Mythology trading cards for Greece or crepes for France). With their research, they'll write a 4-6 page paper about their country. They'll also develop their product and conduct a cost-analysis of it for a market economy day at the end of the month.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#8d2424"><strong>Eighth Grade</strong></font>: We read the most important chapters in <em>The Giver</em>&nbsp;this week and will move along rather quickly in the next week. Things are about to pick up steam in the novel, and I'd like to sustain that momentum all the way through, so there'll be quite a bit of reading done for homework next week, as well as in class with discussions and varying activities. We'll also begin focusing on the end-of-novel paper comparing and contrasting <em>The Giver</em> with another dystopian novel of students' choosing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; I hope everyone has a great weekend!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Mr. Hakim&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

				<div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">Parents,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; This week is a quick update. Just a few reminders, the first is regarding the St. Leo's Book Drive -- if you haven't already, please donate any new or gently used books. It's truly a great sight with all the books filling up the table in the main hallway. Also, Monday is a $1 jeans day, sports team colors day. Wear your favorite team's colors that day, so I'm looking forward to seeing a sea of scarlet and gray walking the halls.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Here's what else to expect next week...<br />&#8203;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <strong><font color="#8d2424">Sixth Grade</font></strong>: To wrap up our discussions on Latin America's physical features and climate, the classes started working on designing a board game related to discussions and notes. The games are due Wednesday, when we'll present them and play each other's games.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <strong><font color="#8d2424">Seventh Grade</font></strong>: Monday ends our unit on the Middle East. We'll have a unit test and will end the unit officially Tuesday and Wednesday with a PBS documentary on the current state of the Middle East. We'll get into Europe after the break.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <strong><font color="#8d2424">Eighth Grade</font></strong>: We're working on a photo activity next week that relates to <em>The Giver</em> and the idea of memory recollection and color's role in helping us remember specific details. The classes will need a color photo, either from early childhood or something more recent, taken from a memorable event/time in their lives.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There won't be an update next week, so I hope everyone has a wonderful Easter and vacation.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Mr. Hakim</div>
