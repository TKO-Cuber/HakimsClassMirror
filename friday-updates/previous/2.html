				<div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">Parents,<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We're two weeks into Reading Month and next week amps things up a bit. As a reminder, Monday is "Read a Button Day," during which everyone will wear a button they designed; Wednesday is "Dress Like Your Favorite Literary Character Day," and this year everyone dresses up, not just the teachers; Thursday is a $1 jeans day and favorite college team day; and on Friday we have author -- and former journalist for the <em>San Francisco Chronicle&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Dallas Morning News</em>&nbsp;-- Kate Hannigan visiting to read and discuss her books, "Cupcake Cousins" and "The Detective's Assistant." Should be a great week for all.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; In addition, next week also begins Homeless Week, our St. Leo's Book Drive is ongoing for anyone who would like to donate new or gently used books, and Wednesday afternoon is an assembly for Jump Rope for Heart. More details are coming regarding JRH.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Here's what's coming up in class next week as well...<br />&#8203;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#8d2424"><strong>Sixth Grade</strong></font>: We've started our unit on Latin America, focusing for the first week on the political boundaries -- labeling the different countries and capitals in the area, differentiating the three regions, and understanding its location on a map. Next week, discussions will move into the physical features of the area and understanding the various landforms and waterways, landmarks and climate/vegetation.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#8d2424"><strong>Seventh Grade</strong></font>: We're wrapping up the Ottoman Empire and moving onto the politics of the Middle East today. A unit test is scheduled for Friday. I'll have a study guide ready either Monday or Tuesday. And after break we'll start our unit on Europe.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#8d2424"><strong>Eighth Grade</strong></font>: In Literature, next week will focus a lot on the understanding and importance of memories, as Jonas, once he's in his new position in "The Giver," is about to learn the truth behind his seemingly idyllic community It's the essence of Lois Lowry's story, one of the major reasons she wrote the story. We'll analyze the concept of memories through a series of studies, games, music videos, etc, as we read through the next few chapters in the novel.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Best of luck to all Science Olympiad competitors this weekend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Have a great weekend!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; A.J.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</div>

The formatting is slightly different, but all the same information is there. One important note, though, is to please still sign and return the reports. There isn't a designated area to sign, but please still do.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Next week is an especially eventful week here. On Tuesday, the seventh grade goes on its NET Retreat, while the sixth grade has its Seder Meal. We also have Reconciliation Monday morning and Stations of the Cross Thursday afternoon, and the eighth grade will attend Cross and the Light Friday morning.

On Tuesday we'll have a "coffeehouse" discussion relating to the fall of the Ottoman Empire and if/how it could've been prevented. Students researched an important figure of the time and will become that person in the discussions, using their research to form an opinion about what that person would say or do..&nbsp;&nbsp; </font><br /><font color="#2a2a2a">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</font> <font color="#8d2424"><strong>Eighth Grade</strong></font><font color="#2a2a2a">: We've been reading and discussing "The Giver," working out the style and tone with which Lois Lowry writes, as well as the relating The Community and its rules/laws to our own lives.

				<div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">Parents,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; I hope all the kids enjoyed the snow day yesterday. It was a nice surprise, especially considering it's the first week back from winter break. Speaking of which, hearing from all the kids, it sounds like everyone had an awesome winter break as well. A lot of skiers in the area.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Anyway, next week is March, which means the start of March is Reading Month. This year's theme is "Tech"nically, I love to Read and focuses on the use of technology in shaping the love/enjoyment of reading. There are quite a few fun activities, contests and dress-up/down days planned. It'll be a great month.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Also next week, progress reports, which will go home in red folders on Friday. Please have them signed and returned to school as soon as possible.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The rest of the week will look as follows:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#8d2424"><strong>Sixth Grade</strong></font>: We're finishing up our unit on the United States and Canada. Notes for the study guide will be posted on the website under the "Unit II" section of sixth grade. Look for it the notes at the top of the page. We'll review Monday and the test will be Tuesday. From there, we're moving onto Latin America and the ancient civilizations of the Aztecs, Mayans and Incas.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#8d2424"><strong>Seventh Grade</strong></font>: We have about two weeks left in our Middle East unit before moving onto Europe. We're currently discussing the Ottoman Empire and the expansion of the Islamic faith in the region. This'll lead us to the Ottoman Empire's decline just before World War I and the events after the Great War that helped shape the Middle East into the region we know it today. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#8d2424"><strong>Eighth Grade</strong></font>: We're about five chapters into The Giver. Much of the discussion with the novel has focused on the characteristics -- laws, behaviors, living conditions -- of utopian/dystopian societies within the first few chapters, as well as the figurative language and the style and tone in which Lois Lowry begins her novel.<br />&#8203;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Before I finish, I just want to congratulate the 7/8 girls on making the CYO basketball playoffs. They play Our Lady of the Lakes at 12:30 Saturday at St. Thecla. Best of luck to the girls. &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I hope you all have a great weekend.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Mr. Hakim&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

From the bottom of my heart, Thank You!&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Another thank you goes out to Mrs. Borrego and Nicholas for the Valentine's Day treats this afternoon.

				<div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;"><font color="#2a2a2a">Parents,</font><br /><br /><font color="#2a2a2a">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; From the looks and sounds of things, Catholic Schools Week was a huge success. From Sunday's Open House to tomorrow's Auction and everything in between, the kids and staff had a blast. Thank you to everyone who had a hand in it, and a special thank you to all the roses and letters from Teacher Appreciation Day. Your children are the reason I love coming to work everyday, and to know they're having fun and enjoying learning in my class makes it all the more special.</font><br /><font color="#2a2a2a">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;But nothing topped the smiles and excitement from Thursday's Special Persons' Day. Seeing the kids' eyes light up when their special person walked into the gym, or the smiles on their faces just being with that person, it's priceless. You and your children are what make St. Paul what it is, and thank you so much for doing so and for everything you do.</font><br /><font color="#2a2a2a">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We're a week away from Winter Break, and as crazy as it sounds, we're only a few months from the end of the year. That said, there's still a lot of work to do and it starts this week. Here's the breakdown of the upcoming week...</font><br /><font color="#2a2a2a">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</font> <strong><font color="#8d2424">Sixth Grade</font></strong><font color="#2a2a2a">: We're learning about the 10 Commandments in Religion in preparation for Stump the Priest with Msgr. Halfpenny either Monday or Tuesday. Should be a fun afternoon, and if we stump him enough, the kids get an ice cream. So, hopefully Msgr. is off his game a little that day. In social studies, we're finishing up our compare/contrast infographs on the U.S. and Canada. We worked on comparing the neighboring countries according to health care, education, military, political parties, government, economics, geography and others. From there, likely after break, we'll move south to Central, Latin and South Americas and the ancient civilizations of the region.</font><br /><font color="#2a2a2a">&#8203; &nbsp; &nbsp; </font><font color="#8d2424"><strong>Seventh Grade</strong></font><font color="#2a2a2a">: We're still in the Middle East, discussing the development of religion and of civilization in the region. The class is currently working on a storybook regarding the origins and beliefs of the three major world religions that originated from the Middle East -- Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. Afterward, we'll move quickly through the region's history on into the Arab Springs and the present-day culture and happenings.</font><br /><font color="#2a2a2a">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; </font><font color="#8d2424"><strong>Eighth Grade</strong></font><font color="#2a2a2a">: In literature, we started reading The Giver this week, and the class was asked to read an additional dystopian novel along with it. The intent being, we'll be able to compare and contrast the two novels according to authors' style and purpose (what are they warning us against, if anything?), the differences in governmental control and societal (dis)obedience, and the main protagonists -- the obstacles he encounters in trying to "free" the society from its oppression. It's a way to challenge them and to further develop their analytical/critical thinking minds by expanding the thought process into a deeper understanding of multiple texts.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Finally, good luck to Beth Reilly and the 5th/6th grade Forensics team at the competition tomorrow morning at St. Lawrence. Having listened to some of the performances, I know St. Paul will have a strong showing tomorrow.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Have a great weekend and enjoy the Super Bowl!<br />&#8203; &nbsp; &nbsp; Mr. Hakim&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</font>&nbsp;</div>

				<div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">Parents,<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Report cards went home today. Please review them, sign and return the envelope to school Monday, which also is the beginning of Catholic Schools Week for the kids. A CSW events schedule went out last week, detailing each day's activities and theme. As a quick refresher, Monday is red, white and blue jeans day in support of the Veterans. Participation is 1.00, and all proceeds will benefit the Veterans. Review the letter from last week for the rest of the week's plans. I'll also remind the class each day.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;While Monday starts CSW for the kids, the official kick-off is this Sunday, January 31, with the St. Paul Open House. It runs 11-1:30 and is a great event/opportunity for anyone interested in their children pursuing a Catholic education. Please tell anyone you know who may be interested to attend Sunday.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;CSW concludes the following Sunday with the Auction 2016, at the Grosse Pointe Yacht Club, Another great event for the school, I'm looking forward to seeing a lot of you there.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Through the excitement of CSW and the varying activities, we still do get to work. Here's the breakdown of next week's classes...<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#8d2424"><strong>Sixth Grade</strong></font>: We're closing the book on the U.S. and Canada unit this week. The classes are working on comparing and contrasting the two countries based on government, economics, geography, history, political parties, education and other such factors. We're answering a series of questions regarding each and creating an infographic chart of the comparisons.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#8d2424"><strong>Seventh Grade</strong></font>: We have a little more time left talking about the major world religions of the Mesopotamian Middle East before moving on to present-day Middle East and the Arab Spring and other events affecting and influencing the region. This week, we're comparing and contrasting Judaism, Christianity and Islam, and will create a storybook&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<font color="#8d2424"><strong> Eighth Grade</strong></font>: Anticipation has been building for us to starting reading <em>The Giver</em>. We've done a lot of work breaking down/analyzing the characteristics of a Utopia and of a dystopia. Using songs, music videos, short stories and other literature/media, we've really wrapped our heads around both ideas and engaged in some very interesting discussions. Now it's time to take what we've learned and apply it to the novel. It'll be an interesting read.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I hope you all have a great weekend! As always, any questions, comments or concerns, please e-mail me and I'll try to respond as soon as possible.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Thanks,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mr. Hakim<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></div>

				<div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">Parents,<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I don't mean to sound like a broken record the past few weeks, but there are a few important school events upcoming, Open House and Auction 2016. Both are invaluable to the future of the school, so it's important we all get the word out and make them as successful as can be.&nbsp;<strong>Open House</strong> is Sunday, January 31, from 11-1:30, and <strong>Auction 2016</strong> is Saturday, February 6, at the Grosse Pointe Yacht Club. RSVP for the auction by next Friday, January 29. Hope to see you all there!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Now, here's what to expect for class next week...<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#8d2424"><strong>Sixth Grade</strong></font>: The AMAZING PROJECT project is over, but we're staying in North America for the time being, at least the next week or so. During that time we're taking what we learned from research during the project and comparing and contrasting that information with Canada. Discussions will focus on Health Care, Government, Economics, Military, Political Parties, Education, Geography, Culture and History. Also, we have a test Monday regarding presentations from the AMAZING RACE project. Students can use their notes and work in their groups to answer the questions.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#8d2424"><strong>Seventh Grade</strong></font>: Still in Ancient Mesopotamian civilizations, we're discussing the birth of the three main religions this week. Namely, the differences and similarities among them. Students will then create a storybook relating class discussions and notes on the topic.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <strong><font color="#8d2424">Eighth Grade</font></strong>: We're under way on our <em>Giver</em> unit, having discussed utopias and dystopias, author's style, tone and purpose. This week, we'll further analyze the concepts of utopias and dystopias through music, the Bible and short stories, before getting into the actual novel, which will likely be Friday or the following Monday.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; As always, please e-mail me with any questions, comments or concerns. I hope everyone has a great weekend!<br />&#8203; &nbsp; &nbsp; Mr. Hakim&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></div>

				<div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">Parents,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; I hope all the kids enjoyed the extra day off today! It was a busy week in the junior high for social studies and literature. Sixth graders organized all their information from the past couple months into slideshows and Prezis and posters and presented their research to both classes. On the Tuesday we get back, they'll use the notes from each presentation to complete an AMAZING RACE-type challenge in the classroom.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; For literature, the eighth graders finished reading <em>The Pearl</em> this week and conducted a mock trial Thursday relating to the novel's main protagonist and if his actions were committed in self defense or murder. It was a fun week for me seeing it all unfold, and I hope the kids enjoyed it just as much.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#8d2424"><strong>Sixth Grade</strong></font>: The fun will continue next week with the AMAZING RACE challenge Tuesday. It's the final piece to all the hard work and research both classes completed the past couple months. In concluding the project, we're officially done with phones, iPads, computers, etc. for the time being. Thank you for allowing the kids to bring them in each day -- and some multiple devices. It's greatly appreciated, and I hope it proved worthwhile for the kids.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#8d2424"><strong>Seventh Grade</strong></font>: We're moving into discussions on the ancient civilizations, starting with Mesopotamia. During the past week, the class discussed what makes a civilization and how they developed in time. Now, in looking at Sumer and other Mesopotamian city-states, we'll talk about all the technological advancements and the developments of a writing system, government, religion, etc.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#8d2424"><strong>Eighth Grade</strong></font>: With <em>The Pearl</em> done, we're moving onto <em>The Giver</em> and our unit on utopias and dystopias. Knowing that the majority of the grade has already read the novel, I like to bring new perspectives into it, giving them a new experience the second -- or third or fourth -- time around. Within the unit, we'll read additional short stories and listen to music relating to the idea of dystopia and utopia. We'll also draft our own ideas of utopia and dystopia. It's an interesting unit and really opens students' minds to better understand the world around them.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Have a great weekend!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mr. Hakim<br /><br />P.S. Some additional notes...<ul><li><strong>Open House</strong> is Sunday, January 31, from 11-1:30. If you have anyone interested in their child(ren) attending St. Paul, please have them visit, or have them stop in for a school tour.&nbsp;&#8203;</li><li><strong>Auction 2016</strong> is almost here as well. It's Saturday, February 6, at the Grosse Pointe Yacht Club, and is a great community event with a lot of awesome raffle and auction items. Expect&nbsp;the themed basket raffle tickets flier to come home Tuesday.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Catholic Schools Week</strong> runs the first week of February, culminating in the Auction. It'll be a fun week for the kids, who'll participate in&nbsp;numerous activities and service opportunities throughout the week.</li></ul></div>

				<div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Happy New Year! It feels like forever ago that I last wrote a Friday update. Listening to the kids, it sounded like everyone enjoyed their holiday breaks or vacations, which is great to hear. Before we get into the week ahead, a few notes:&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; We're in need of lunch volunteers and recess duty. Contact the office if you're interested and able to help out.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Please remember, there's no school for the junior high this Friday, January 15, and no school for everyone Monday, January 18.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Open House, Catholic Schools Week and the Auction 2016 are fast approaching. <strong>Open House is Sunday, January 31, from 11-1:30</strong>. Please pass the information along to anyone you know who could use it, or who knows someone else who could use it. <strong>Catholic Schools Week is the week of February 1</strong>. More information will follow in the coming weeks as we get it. <strong>Auction 2016 is February 6</strong>, at the Grosse Pointe Yacht Club. It's a great event and a great way to support the school, as it's our biggest fundraising event of the year.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Here's a breakdown of next week...<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#8d2424"><strong>Sixth Grade</strong></font>: Our AMAZING RACE projects are all but complete. Groups are putting the finishing touches on their presentations and will present them likely Tuesday and Wednesday of this week, with the actual race taking place Thursday. It'll be fun to see the results of all their hard work the past month or so. From there, we'll start with the relationship between the United States and Canada, then move on to South America and the ancient civilizations.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#8d2424"><strong>Seventh Grade</strong></font>: The class just started Mesopotamia and the other Early River Valley Civilizations. We'll spend the next week talking about the birth of government, writing, and religion as well as major advancements in technology from this era.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#8d2424"><strong>Eighth Grade</strong></font>: I hope everything went well today for the eighth graders who went to North or South to choose their classes. In class next week, we'll be finishing <em>The Pearl</em>&nbsp;and will begin our unit on dystopias/utopias, during which we'll read&nbsp;<em>The Giver</em>.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; As always, please contact me with any questions, concerns or comments. Thank you for all you do, and have a great weekend!<br /><br />Mr. Hakim<br /></div>

				<div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">Parents,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; I'd like to start by congratulating the Spelling Bee participants and winners. For the 7th/8th grade, Dominic Dulac won and Ryan English finished runner up, and for the 5th/6th, Alex English won and Quinn Gorski and George Gardey tied for runners up. It's a great accomplishment and honor to advance to the grade-level stage and beyond. Best of luck to all in the next round.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I'd also like to wish the 7th/8th grade Forensics team luck at its competition Saturday, December 12, at St. Joan of Arc. It takes a special talent to compete in Forensics, and St. Paul has some special people representing us tomorrow and in the upcoming 5th/6th grade competition. Best of luck to the Forensics team as well.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A quick note before getting into next week, please check out St. Paul's online auction, if you haven't already done so. The auction closes Sunday at 10 p.m. Visit stpaulonthelake.com and click the Auction logo to enter the site and bid.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Moving onto next week. Here's a breakdown of what to expect in class for the week.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#8d2424"><strong>Sixth Grade</strong></font>: Our AMAZING RACE project is nearing its completion. We're finishing up on the culture and history and natural resources pieces, and on Monday we'll start putting together our research into the group presentations. Our plan is to have the presentations completed by Friday. When we return from break, we'll give a quick review, the groups will put together challenge questions for the "race," and then they'll present their projects.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; We also have our Christmas Party Friday afternoon. A special Thank You to Mrs. Kesteloot and, Mrs. Borrego for putting it together.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#8d2424"><strong>Seventh Grade</strong></font>: We've started our North Africa and Middle East unit, having worked on the physical features and political maps of the region this past week. On Monday, we'll shift our focus slightly to the question of, How can the physical environment and climate affect how people live? We'll discuss the water scarcity issue in the region, as well as its heavy reliance economically on petroleum and natural gas.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#8d2424"><strong>Eighth Grade</strong></font>: Classes are now midway through The Pearl. We're starting to see a change in the main character's beliefs and attitude. They have a one-page analysis due Wednesday regarding that behavioral change. Next week, we'll relate the novella to "The Parable of the Hidden Treasure and the Pearl" from Matthew 13:44-46. Many critics believe Steinbeck took literal meaning from the parable's message during the writing process of his novella. Based on the parable's meaning, the class will relate it to the novella and offer predictions of what's to come.&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; I hope everyone has a wonderful weekend! Good luck this weekend to the athletics teams, Forensics and any other programs, school-related or not.<br /><br />Mr. Hakim&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#8203; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
